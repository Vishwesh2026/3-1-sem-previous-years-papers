# What is Network topology? List any 3 network topologies. 
# Network Topologies

**Network topology** is the geometric arrangement of a network's nodes and links, defining how devices (nodes) connect and interact. Different topologies offer unique advantages and challenges. The main types of network topologies include **Mesh**, **Star**, **Bus**, **Ring**, and **Hybrid**.

---

## 1. Mesh Topology
In a **mesh topology**, every device has a dedicated point-to-point link to every other device. This type of topology is fully connected, with each link handling traffic between only the two devices it connects. The number of links required for a fully connected mesh network with _n_ nodes can be calculated using the formula:  
**`n(n - 1) / 2`**.

### Advantages:
1. **Dedicated Connections**: Each connection can handle its own data load, reducing traffic issues.
2. **Robustness**: If one link fails, the rest of the network remains functional.
3. **Privacy and Security**: Dedicated links provide better security as data does not pass through other nodes.

### Disadvantages:
1. **High Cost**: Requires extensive cabling and I/O ports, which can be costly.
2. **Difficult to Install**: Connecting every device to every other device complicates installation and maintenance.

---

## 2. Star Topology
In a **star topology**, each device connects to a central hub with a dedicated point-to-point link. Devices do not directly communicate with each other; instead, all data flows through the hub, which manages and relays messages.

### Advantages:
1. **Cost-Effective**: Requires fewer cables than mesh, making it more affordable.
2. **Easy to Install and Configure**: Simple design and minimal cabling allow for quick setup.
3. **Robustness**: Failure of one link affects only that device, not the entire network.

### Disadvantage:
1. **Single Point of Failure**: If the central hub fails, the entire network becomes inoperative.

---

## 3. Bus Topology
In a **bus topology**, all devices are connected to a single backbone cable. Each device attaches to the bus via drop lines and taps, allowing multiple nodes to share the same link.

### Advantages:
1. **Ease of Installation**: The backbone cable can be laid efficiently along the optimal path.

### Disadvantages:
1. **Difficult to Reconfigure and Troubleshoot**: Reconnecting or isolating issues can be challenging.
2. **Single Cable Failure**: A break in the bus cable halts communication for the entire network.

---

## 4. Ring Topology
In a **ring topology**, each device connects to exactly two others, forming a circular data path. Signals travel in one direction around the ring, passing through each device until they reach the destination.

### Advantages:
1. **Simple Installation**: Ring topology is easy to set up and reconfigure.
2. **Fault Isolation**: Signal monitoring helps detect and isolate issues within the network.

### Disadvantages:
1. **Single Point of Failure**: A break in the ring can disable the entire network unless redundancy is built-in.

---

## 5. Hybrid Topology
**Hybrid topology** combines features of two or more different topologies to create a customized network structure. For example, a central star topology could branch into smaller bus networks.

### Advantages:
1. **Flexible and Scalable**: Allows for the benefits of multiple topologies, optimized for specific needs.
2. **Fault Tolerance**: Redundant paths from different topologies enhance network reliability.

---

Each topology has its unique strengths, and the choice of topology depends on the network's requirements, including cost, scale, and reliability.

## Explain the functionality of each layer in OSI reference model. 


# OSI Reference Model Layers and Their Functionalities

The **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection)** model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a communication system into seven distinct layers. Each layer serves a specific purpose, facilitating communication between devices across a network. Here’s an overview of each layer:

---

- **Key Responsibilities**:
  - Defines hardware elements involved, such as cables, switches, and network interface cards (NICs).
  - Manages data encoding, signal modulation, and transmission rates.
  - Ensures proper electrical, optical, or radio signaling.

---

## 2. Data Link Layer (Layer 2)
- **Function**: This layer provides node-to-node data transfer and handles error detection and correction to ensure reliable data transmission.
- **Key Responsibilities**:
  - Divides data into frames for transmission.
  - Adds error-checking mechanisms, such as CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check).
  - Controls access to the physical medium via protocols like MAC (Media Access Control).

---

## 3. Network Layer (Layer 3)
- **Function**: The Network layer handles data routing, packet forwarding, and logical addressing across multiple networks.
- **Key Responsibilities**:
  - Determines the best path for data to travel from source to destination using routing protocols.
  - Manages IP addressing, including source and destination IPs in packets.
  - Supports internetworking across diverse networks.

- **Key Responsibilities**:
  - Segments large data into smaller packets for efficient transmission.
  - Provides error recovery and flow control to maintain data integrity.
  - Manages end-to-end communication using protocols like TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).

---

## 5. Session Layer (Layer 5)
- **Function**: The Session layer establishes, manages, and terminates connections between applications on different devices.
- **Key Responsibilities**:
  - Organizes and synchronizes communication sessions.
  - Manages session checkpoints and recovery, allowing data to resume from a certain point after an interruption.
  - Coordinates duplex or half-duplex operations to enable effective data exchange.

---

## 6. Presentation Layer (Layer 6)
- **Function**: This layer translates data between the application layer and the network format, ensuring data is readable across diverse systems.
- **Key Responsibilities**:
  - Handles data translation, encryption, and compression.
  - Ensures data format compatibility for applications on different platforms.
  - Provides encoding and decoding as needed for data interoperability.

---

## 7. Application Layer (Layer 7)
- **Function**: The Application layer serves as the interface between end-user applications and the OSI model, providing network services to applications.
- **Key Responsibilities**:
  - Facilitates network services like file transfer, email, and web browsing.
  - Supports protocols such as HTTP, FTP, and SMTP to enable application-level data exchange.
  - Manages network access, authentication, and data integrity for application services.

---

Each layer in the OSI model performs a specific function to enable smooth communication across diverse systems, helping standardize network protocols and improving interoperability.
